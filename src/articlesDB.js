    //             "So I have to admit I did't really like the last movie Holloween which came out in 2018, so I wasn't expecting much from Holloween Kills, just hoping for a horror movie with good kills and a holloween atomspher. Thankfully  Holloween Kills delivered all that and much more, this film has one of the best kills in the frenchies and the most menacing looking Michael Myers. I Also loved that they brought back characters  from the first flim, It realy adds to the feeling that this film is part of the same Michael Myers universe.",
    //             "Just like any slasher  horror film theres always some characters  that do some stupid mistakes that get them killed, you might catch your self yelling at the screen a few times.",
    //             "I had so much fun watching this movie, this flim  really brought back the feeling of watching a good horror movie on holloween night. I was never to familiar with the holloween frenchies , I did see parts of the first film when i was kid and the Holloween H20  when i was a teenager. I was never really impressesd with those films, I was always more of a jason fan. After watching this movie I have to say I'm a Michael Myers fan.  Michael Myers is just a much more Horrifying character which has a lot to do with his Mysterious nature. We  never get to much information on him and don't really understand the force thats driving him, all we know is that he is evil and not really sure if he is even mortal. Which alllows people's minds to wonder and come up with there own theories. I give Holloween Kills a score of  9 out 10!",

                "Taissa Farmiga stars in The Final Girls  a comedic rift of Friday the 13th dircected by Todd Strauss Schulson. The movie is about a about teen girl named Max played by (Taissa Farmiga),  Who's mother a struggling actress  played by (Malin Akerman) tragically die's in a car accident.  three years after her mother's  death Max and her friends are in a theater watching Camp Blood Bath a 80's horror movie her late mother stared in. While watching the movie a fire occurres, with no way to escape other then going through the screen, Max and her friends cut a pathway into the screen only to end up in the movie themselves.",
                "In my opinion they chose a perfect cast in order to bring a fun atmosphere to the movie. Adam DeVine was just hilarious in this flim and a huge part of the comdeic formula. Thomas Middleditch was also pretty funny and had me laughing  acouple of times during the movie, He dose a great job with his character playing the horror/slasher fan nerd. Taissa Farmiga reminded me of Jennifer Love Hewitt in (I Know What You Did Last Summer), As the  shy pretty girl who ends up becoming more confident as the movie gose on. The only flaw I saw was with  Alexander Ludwig's character, Not sure if it was the script or the pertformce but the character was just a bit dull. Nina Dobrev dose a great job playing the classic popular mean girl in a slasher flim. Overall great cast!",
                "This film also dose a amazing job showcasing the emotional aspects of the mother daurther relationship between Max and Amanda. Exploring what it would be like to see a late loved again, Even if it wasn't really them but just a character they played in a movie. Which definitely made the movie that much more interesting. For the slasher movie fans out there this movie has some brutal yet funny kills scenes. I really enjoyed the  cinematography, Just thought it was really creative how the camera would movie from one character to another during tense moments in the film.",
                "I flet a few charecters lacked depth and could've beinfited from some charecter building , But otherwise this movie has very few flaws.",
                "I really enjoyed this movie it  was very fun to watch, great cast, interesting plot and very funny comdeic scenes. The Final Girls is definitely a must watch scoring  8 out 10!",
