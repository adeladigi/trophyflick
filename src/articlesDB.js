        title: "The Final Girls : Movie Review",
        about: [
                "Taissa Farmiga stars in The Final Girls  a comedic rift of Friday the 13th dircected by Todd Strauss Schulson. The movie is about a about teen girl named Max played by (Taissa Farmiga),  Who's mother a struggling actress  played by (Malin Akerman) tragically die's in a car accident.  three years after her mother's  death Max and her friends are in a theater watching Camp Blood Bath a 80's horror movie her late mother stared in. While watching the movie a fire occurres, with no way to escape other then going through the screen, Max and her friends cut a pathway into the screen only to end up in the movie themselves.",
                "In my opinion they choose a perfect cast in order to bring a fun atmosphere to the movie. Adam DeVine was just hilarious in this flim and huge part of the comdeic formula. Thomas Middleditch was also pretty funny and had me laughing  acouple of times during the movie, He dose a great job with his character playing the horror/slasher fan nerd. Taissa Farmiga reminded of Jennifer Love Hewitt in (I Know What You Did Last Summer), As the  shy pertty girl who ends up becoming more confident as the movie gose on. The only flaw I saw was with  Alexander Ludwig's character, Not sure if it was the script or the pertformce but the character was just a bit dull. Nina Dobrev dose a great job playing the classic popular mean girl in a slasher flim. Overall great cast!",
                "This film also dose a amazing job showcasing the emotional aspects of the mother daurther relationship between Max and Amanda. Exploring what it would be like to see a late loved again, Even if it wasn't really them but just a character they played in a movie. Which definitely made the movie that much more interesting. For the slasher movie fans out there this movie has some brutal yet funny kills scenes. I really enjoyed the  cinematography, Just thought it was really creative how the camera would movie from one character to another during tense moments in the film.",
                "I flet a few charecters lacked depth and could've beinfited from some charecter building , But otherwise this movie has very few flaws.",
                "I really enjoyed this movie it  was very fun to watch, great cast, interesting plot and very funny comdeic scenes. This is definitely a must watch scoring  8 out 10!",

//     title: "Night Shift",
//     about: [
//             {title: "plot", paragraph: "The plot of Night Shift revolves around three police officers, Virginie (Virginie Efira), Aristide (Omar Sy) and Erik (Grégory Gadebois) who have been assigned the task by their department to deport an illegal immigrant named Tohirov (Payman Maadi) from the French territory to his homeland Tajikistan. But this is not any normal deportation. Fontaine oils up the plot and makes it take a sinister turn as the officers are pushed over the edge during their long and trying night duty. The plot goes on to reveal an unknown danger that their prisoner faces in his homeland."},
//             {title: "Cast", paragraph: "Night shift is packed by renowned actors like Virginie Efira, Omar Sy, Grégory Gadebois and Payman Maadi. I feel Maadi as the unfortunate, bewildered and panic-stricken handcuffed prisoner completely stole the show. I was entirely engrossed in learning what misfortunes he would face as the plot moved on. Gadebois too spiced up the play with his agitated and moody Erik character who faces marital frustrations and a bizarre relationship with the bottle."},
//             {title: "the good", paragraph: "Honestly, anyone would expect a police drama to have cops countering dreadful criminals with gunshots fired from both sides. But not Night Shift! With not a single gunshot fired, the film’s engrossing plot kept matters interesting with tensions boiling inside the squad vehicle. After watching too many violent movies, this gripping cop-detainee tale did make a benefiting transition to my viewing experience."},
//             {title: "the bad", paragraph: "The extramarital affair of Virginie with Aristide spiced up the deal. Omar Sy grabs some attention with his heroic, sensitive and warm character that can make women take solace in him. So did Virginie, as things were not going well in her marital life. I have come across many films which highlight the extramarital concept. However, I feel that this was unnecessary and was simply put in a cop drama like Night Shift to spice up matters. Besides, an extramarital affair that too ending up in a pregnancy is direly unethical!"},
//             {title: "verdict", paragraph: "The cinematography by Yves Angelo coupled with a snappy editing by Fabrice Rouaud added to the intensity of Night Shift with a portrayal of a murky, oppressive and dilemma-filled night atmosphere. I feel the camerawork did the best to intensify Fontaine’s screenplay.Night Shift has Virginie’s character torn between personal and professional dilemmas. I believe that as a woman she might have had more compassion for a poor soul like Tohirov as compared to others. The story ends in an uncertainty with the three cops winding up their grievances with regard to the fate of their captive. If you ask me, I would say that Night Shift is a thriller indeed. But rather than a crime thriller, I think it could have been better tagged as a psychological thriller."},
