        title: "The MCU Just Repeated Phase 2’s Jane Foster Insult",
        about: "Marvel's What If...? episode 7 sees shield insult Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a pattern first started in the MCU Phase 2. In What If... Thor Were An Only Child?, Jane and her intern, Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), sounds the alarm that the Earth is about to be invaded by aliens, although it turns out to be a still-worthy Thor (Chris Hemsworth) inviting the Marvel Cinematic Universe's menagerie of cosmic beings to party on the third rock from the sun. Jane ends up looking foolish in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s eyes as she becomes smitten with Thor, and What If...? marginalizes Dr. Foster once more in this alternate universe.Introduced in Thor, Dr. Jane Foster is one of the world's leading astrophysicists, but her professional work usually takes a backseat to her status as the God of Thunder's girlfriend in MCU Phases 1 and 2. Jane and Thor are separated after the first film and she spends years pining for him while he helps form the Avengers and stops Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) Chitauri invasion. Jane and Thor are reunited when she is infected by the Aether in Thor: The Dark World and the Odinson brings Jane to Asgard to meet his parents. But Natalie Portman spent several years on the outs with Marvel Studios, which meant for all of MCU Phase 3, Jane was written out and Dr. Foster has no role in the Infinity Saga. Thor only fleetingly mentions his breakup with Jane in Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Endgame. But Natalie Portman agreed to make her MCU return and Jane will become the Goddess of Thunder in Thor: Love and Thunder. Portman and Marvel Studios being sympatico again also allowed the Academy Award-winner to voice Jane in What If...? episode 7.",

        title: "Midnight Mass' Monster Explained: What Is It Really?",
        about: "Midnight Mass introduces a monster of vampiric quality, though is referred to by the characters as an angel - so what really is it? Serving as horror director Mike Flanagan’s follow-up to his critically acclaimed The Haunting of Hill House and The Haunting of Bly Manor shows on Netflix, Midnight Mass is a terrifying and illuminating tale of a small religious community on Crockett Island that becomes corrupted by the supernatural when a new priest arrives. The show resembles the novel of the same name by F. Paul Wilson, but its story is entirely separate from that, and it's something that has actually been built up through inclusions in Flanagan’s movies Hush and Gerald’s Game.",

        title: "Sex Education: Why Ruby Attacks Hope During The Open Day",
        about: "Sex Education season 3 villain Hope is dethroned in a scuffle against Ruby Matthews, but it's still unclear why the character was chosen for the task. Hope Haddon (Jemima Kirke) is introduced straight away as Moordale Secondary’s new headmistress at the start of season 3. She is given the unenviable task of restoring the institution’s public image after being labeled a “Sex School” by the media. Hope comes on strong trying to be a hip, progressive mentor for key students she’s trying to manipulate but very quickly does some despicable things with her power.",

        title: "Star Wars Reveals A New, Better Way Lightsaber Blades Can Change Color",
        about: "Disney+'s new anime anthology series, Star Wars: Visions, has introduced a fascinating new way for lightsabers to change color. Each of the show’s nine episodes features a unique visual style and tells a self-contained story set somewhere within George Lucas’ Star Wars universe. In Star Wars: Visions episode 5, “The Ninth Jedi,” a lightsaber craftsman named Zhima reveals a whole new way to temper kyber crystals to cause the colors of lightsabers to change.",
